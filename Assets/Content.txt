Demo

A demo that shows Aion in action.
It is optional and you can delete it if you dont need it.

There are two scenes inside this folder:

- BasicScene.unity is the simplest one and is made by a plane and a cube.
  The time control is managed by adding a component.

- SampleScene.unity is more complex as it features many cubes and a user interface.
  The time control is managed by tags.
